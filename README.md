# Python_Libraries
Set of code examples that involve NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and a real-world program that shows Hulu Stats.

# Note - these are just ready made samples - not full programs
Feel free to download the repo and play around with your own mock stats, labels, and colors.
These are made with beginner level code, which means the way these are created can be better written with more advanced technqiues. Treat this as a food sample from a mall when they wave you down to try samples of sesame chicken.

** If for any reason you have trouble with installing libraries or want to know how to install these three libraries/packages, here's some install steps. (If you haven't installed Python on your machine, please do so before installing libraries to avoid errors.)**



Using Pip:
Open your terminal window and enter the following:
For NumPy:
 pip install numpy

 *** Or for Python3 enter ***

 pip3 install numpy

Same can be done for the other two libraries!
 
Pandas:
 pip install pandas
 pip3 install pandas

Matplotlib:
pip install matplotlib
pip3 install matplotlib
 
Happy Coding!!
